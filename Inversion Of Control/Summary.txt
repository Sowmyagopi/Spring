Inversion Of control:
=====================

 -- It basically means that out application is gonna outsource the creation and management of objects, and the outsourcing will be handled by object factory.
 -- here spring container is the object factory

here,

1. applicationContext.xml - Spring Container
2. MyAppIoc.java - Main method
3. CoachIoc.java - interface 
4. BaseballCoachIoc.javac 

Spring Bean:
============

Spring bean is simply a java Object. When java objects are created by the spring container, then spring refers them as "Spring Beans".
