Bean Life cycle
===============

	During the bean life cycle, spring allows you to call some of your own custom code to execute during bean initialization (or) destruction

1. BaseballCoachBeanLifeCycle.java --> java class
2. beanLifeCycle-applicationContext.xml --> config file
3. CoachBeanLifeCycle.java --> interface
4. FortuneServiceBeanLifeCycle.java --> dependency interface
5. HappyFortuneServiceBeanLifeCycle.java --> dependency class
6. MyAppBeanLifeCycle.java --> main method
